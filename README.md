# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. Each folder corresponds to a specific DSA topic where you can find code examples and implementations.

## Topics Covered

1. **Arrays**: Basic operations, sorting algorithms, 2D arrays.
2. **ArrayList**: Implementation and operations.
3. **LinkedList**: Singly linked list implementation.
4. **Stack**: Array-based and linked list-based implementations.
5. **Queue**: Array-based and linked list-based implementations.
6. **Binary Tree**: Implementation and traversal algorithms.
7. **Binary Search Tree**: Insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
8. **Heap**: Max heap and min heap implementations.
9. **Hashing**: Hash table implementation and collision handling.
10. **Tries**: Trie data structure for efficient string operations.
11. **Graph**: Graph representation and traversal algorithms.
12. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Solutions to various problems using dynamic programming.
13. **Greedy Algorithm**: Implementations of greedy algorithms.
14. **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
15. **String**: String manipulation and algorithms.
16. **Bit Manipulation**: Bitwise operations and algorithms.
17. **Recursion**: Recursive algorithms and problems.
18. **Divide and Conquer**: Divide and conquer algorithms and applications.
19. **Backtracking**: Backtracking algorithms and applications.

## Structure

Each topic is organized into its own directory with relevant Java files and sometimes additional resources or READMEs explaining concepts and algorithms.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance existing implementations, add new algorithms, or improve documentation are welcome! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new algorithm'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
